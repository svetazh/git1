Where do I begin? 
To tell the story of how great a love can be 
The sweet love story that is older than the sea 
The simple truth about the love he brings to me 
Where do I start? 

Like a summer rain 
That cools the pavement with a patent leather shine 
He came into my life and made the living fine 
And gave a meaning to this empty world of mine 
He fills my heart
